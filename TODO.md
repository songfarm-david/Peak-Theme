#TODO:
1. Ensure all images, particularly the hero image, is dynamic
2. Add second editable section to landing page (hero text/banner)

#Testing:
1. User-Test font size on various devices (see _breakpoints.scss for screen sizes). 
    - At a glance, tests should be done on mobile phones, tablets, all the way up to screen size beyond 1900px.

# Design additions
- Include "badges", i.e: CSS3, HTML5, PHP, WP. These are, essentially, technologies that Peak Websites is versed in.
