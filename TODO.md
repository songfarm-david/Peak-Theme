- Style/add sticky header without use of JavaScript if possible
- Introduce 'Last updated' meta entry for blog posts (like Backlinko).

- remove non-critical blog posts from live site blog feed
- find regex to replace blog date strings to omit them
- fix figcaption shortcode width blog posts

# SEO
- Visit https://searchwebwork.info/contacts.htm and http://www.infotechvi.com/index.php to see about adding business citations here. Or search 'local business 1' 'local business 2' and look for directory sites that way, OR, use link intersection tools online.

# Testing:
1. User-Test font size on various devices (see _breakpoints.scss for screen sizes). 
    - At a glance, tests should be done on mobile phones, tablets, all the way up to screen size beyond 1900px.
2. Social Media buttons on mobile are clickable (everything on mobile is clickable)

# Design additions
- Include "badges", i.e: CSS3, HTML5, PHP, WP. These are, essentially, technologies that Peak Websites is versed in.
- Add a poll somewhere on the page, trying to find out something like business owner's biggest pain point.
