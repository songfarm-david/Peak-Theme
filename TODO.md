#TODO:
1. Ensure all images, particularly the hero image, is dynamically loaded
2. Add second editable section to landing page (hero text/banner)
3. Create portfolio page, link to it from About Peak: "We have delivered on our promises for businesses before. (link to portfolio)"
4. Setup same Google Analytics on website, mark as landmark event in Google
5. Change footer widget 'Recent Posts' to 'Most Popular Posts'

#Testing:
1. User-Test font size on various devices (see _breakpoints.scss for screen sizes). 
    - At a glance, tests should be done on mobile phones, tablets, all the way up to screen size beyond 1900px.

# Design additions
- Include "badges", i.e: CSS3, HTML5, PHP, WP. These are, essentially, technologies that Peak Websites is versed in.
